# Elysium

*Exploring French language and culture*


**Elysium** is a vast open source project dedicated to studying French language and culture; it consists of several subprojects:

* [Rayon](https://github.com/giancosta86/Rayon) - a modern Java 8 library to parse the GLAWI lexicon

* [Esprit](https://github.com/giancosta86/Esprit) - to perform Data Mining analysis using Rayon

* [Marianne](https://github.com/giancosta86/Marianne) - a user-friendly website, with a related Facebook page, to learn French - not only the language, but the culture as well
